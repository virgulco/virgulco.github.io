**Virgul.co** is a technology blog where I mostly share my software experiences, problems and projects I encounter on a weekly basis.
It is also a small contribution to the open source world. All kinds of questions, opinions, suggestions, even 'I have an idea but..' everything you say.
Feel free to contact with me on my e-mail (burak@virgul.co).


## Personal Informations
I was born in Balikesir/Turkey at 1993 of July. In 1998, my father bought a computer that name is "Escort". I learnt using PC with Chip and PCOyun magazines.
The first website that I entered with ixir and 56K modem (that's my first internet provider) is grafi2000. When we realized that the internet was something that could end, I unplugged it and played flash games with offline mode of Internet Explorer.
